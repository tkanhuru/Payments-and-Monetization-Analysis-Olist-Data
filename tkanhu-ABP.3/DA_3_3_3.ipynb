        "Your manager is very happy with the data you provided him the week before, but now he is interested in how you can handle analysis on your own. He does not give you concrete questions to be answered, just asks you to use any data in the company databases and come up with a useful analysis on your own. It can be from different aspects of the business, but he expects you to provide him with at least 3-5 insights about business.\n",
        "\n",
        "You should use tables from [olist_db](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?project=tc-da-1&ws=!1m5!1m4!4m3!1stc-da-1!2solist_db!3solist_customesr_dataset&j=bq:US:bquxjob_439ea020_17f990edf1c&page=queryresults) to come up with an analysis on your own. You will have to write SQL queries to extract needed data, then analyze and visualize this data either with Google Sheets or other data visualization tools. After all this, you will have to come up with a presentation oriented to executives from your company. Have in mind your audience for the presentation, these will be business oriented people who are not data analysts and may not have studied statistics before.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Write SQL queries to extract needed data, these queries should be well documented, with indentation and provided in separate file\n",
        "- Provide your analysis in Google Sheets or any other data visualization tool, have in mind that this file should contain all the things you tried to look at even if they did not bring any useful insights\n",
        "- Provide presentation with around 10 slides which would be business focused and would present only the most interesting 3-5 insights\n",
        "- See whether you can apply at least 2 techniques learned in this or previous sprints\n",
        "- Explore the data. See whether there are interesting data points that can give more insights to your presentation.\n",
        "- Provide analytical insights, what are the drawbacks of this analysis, what further analysis could you recommend? \n",

        "\n",
        "*Tip: to make valuable business insights, itâ€™s almost never enough to only look at the data. It is often very beneficial to do some additional research about the industry and the business as well. Such ability to learn quickly about different domains is an extremely valuable skill, especially when starting jobs at new companies.*\n",

Contact Turing Staff via the chat function in the platform to receive it (unfortunately, the system cannot currently give early access to notebooks from different modules). Once the project review is completed, you will see this content in the Turing platform normally.\n"
